# ass1
my first practice on creating a new repository
ive created the github account
then i started to learn the github 10min tutorial
practising the same parallely
first,ive learnt that repositores contain folders,files,datasets,spreadsheets whatever required for a project
then i have created a repository named ass1 since its my todays assignment under my account name vamsi-devops-git
in this repository whatever data i kept can be saved as a file using READ-ME option
then i need to do changes on this file
so i take a copy of it first and create a file in which changes or edits can be made,thoses changes which are saved called commits.
taking a copy of it from main is called Branching
file name same undi kani branch maarithe data change cheskovachu...same file name in different folders and different data.
